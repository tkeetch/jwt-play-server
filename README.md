## What?

This project implements a Token-based authentication service using JWT (RFC 7519). It uses the jose4j JWT library.

## Why?

I wrote this code to familiarise myself with Scala, Play, jQuery and GitHub.

## How?

Build & run using SBT:
> sbt run

Visit http://localhost:9000/login for a single-page web application that consumes the service using AJAX and CORS. 

Test valid credentials are tom/tom.
